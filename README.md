# Ahmed Samy

**Computer Graphics Engineer** specializing in real-time rendering, systems architecture, and cross-platform development.

## What I Do

I build high-performance graphics applications and explore the intersection of hardware capabilities and creative expression. Currently working on experimental graphics research in **The Lab** 🔬

## Technical Stack

**Graphics & Rendering**
- C++ | C | RUST | GLSL | HLSL shader development
- OpenGL | DirectX | Vulkan
- Data-Oriented Design & OOP

**Full-Stack & Systems**
- React | Electron
- Python/Lua scripting
- Arduino | ESP32 embedded systems

## Focus Areas

- Real-time rendering optimization
- Custom shader development
- Cross-platform graphics applications
- Hardware-software integration
- Performance-critical system design

## Approach

I prioritize performance and hardware-aware design while building scalable systems. Every project is an opportunity to push the boundaries of what's computationally possible.
